If you've two-step verification enabled, your regular password won't work. Instead, generate an app-specific password:

- Go to your Google Account.
- On the left navigation panel, click on "Security."
- Under "Signing in to Google," select "App Passwords." You might need to sign in again.
- At the bottom, choose the app and device you want the app password for, then select "Generate."
- Use this app password in your Streamlit app.
